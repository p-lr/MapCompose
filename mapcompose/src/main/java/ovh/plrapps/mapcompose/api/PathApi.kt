 * Adds a path, optionally setting some properties.
 *
 * @param id The unique identifier of the path
 * @param pathData Obtained from [PathDataBuilder.build]
 * @param width The width of the path, in [Dp]. Defaults to 4.dp
 * @param color The color of the path. Defaults to Color(0xFF448AFF)
 * @param offset The number of points to skip from the beginning of the path. Defaults to 0.
 * @param count The number of points to draw after [offset]. Defaults to the number of points added
 * to built [pathData].
 * @param cap The cap style at the start and end of the path. Defaults to [Cap.Round].
 * @param simplify By default, the path is simplified depending on the scale to improve performance.
 * Higher values increase the simplification effect, while a value of 0f effectively disables path
 * simplification. Sensible values a typically in the range [0.5f..2f]. Default value is 1f.
 * @param clickable Controls whether the path is clickable. Default is false. If a click listener
 * is registered using [onPathClick], that listener will be invoked for that marker if [clickable]
 * is true.
 * @param zIndex A path with larger zIndex will be drawn on top of paths with smaller zIndex.
 * When paths have the same zIndex, the more recently added path is drawn on top of the others.
